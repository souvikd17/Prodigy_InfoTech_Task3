# Decision Tree Classifier - Customer Purchase Prediction

This project involves building a decision tree classifier in R to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. Using a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing), the goal is to develop a predictive model to analyze customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.

## Project Highlights
- Preprocessing demographic and behavioral data
- Building and fine-tuning a decision tree classifier in R
- Practical application in marketing and customer targeting

## Skills Gained
- Decision tree modeling with R (e.g., `rpart`, `caret` packages)
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Interpretation of decision tree results
